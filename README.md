# DeFi Bug Hunting Challenge üêõ
A collection of intentionally vulnerable Lending/Borrowing smart contracts for learning and practicing smart contract security. Test your bug hunting skills by finding critical issues in lending protocols!

## Overview

This repository contains simplified version of lending protocol with intentionally planted vulnerabilities. The goal is to help developers and security researchers practice identifying common lending protocol vulnerabilities.

## Challenges

Challenges and explanations are in the '/Challenges/...' folder, auditors will look at here first in order to find the bugs. 

## How to Play

1. **Challenge Yourself First!**
   - Review the smart contracts in the `/Challenges/...` folder
   - Try to identify the vulnerabilities
   - Think about potential attack vectors


2. **Check Your Findings**
   - Once you think you've found the bug, check the `/Solutions/...` folder
   - Compare your findings with the detailed explanation
   - Learn from any aspects you might have missed
